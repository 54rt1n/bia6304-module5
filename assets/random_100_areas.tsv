21	bennett-spring-fish-hatchery	Bennett Spring Fish Hatchery	Missouri Conservation Areas	Education	Fish Hatchery	 Bennett Spring Fish Hatchery Bennett Spring Fish Hatchery In 1924 and 1925, the Missouri State Park system purchased 573 acres of land, including Bennett Spring and the hatchery. This area formed the nucleus of today's Bennett Spring State Park. The area had been known as Brice, Missouri and was a place where farmers could have their grain milled. While waiting for the mill to grind their grain the families would enjoy the natural beauty of the spring and fish in the cold, clear stream.Around 1900 the Neosho National Fish Hatchery stocked Bennett Spring with rainbow trout. This stocking proved to be so popular with customers that a hatchery was built to maintain the fishery. The goal of providing a quality outdoor experience for customers was the driving force then, just as it is today. The hatchery, operated by the Missouri Department of Conservation, now provides approximately 400,000 rainbow trout to anglers each year. These fish are stocked from March through October on a nightly basis in Bennett Spring State Park. A small number of brown trout are also stocked. Downstream, the Niangua River also receives monthly commitments of trout year-round. The hatchery can be accessed by driving west on Highway 64 approximately 12 miles from Lebanon, Missouri. Visitors can enjoy the natural beauty and many outdoor activities today just as they did at the turn of the last century.

Always be aware of alternate routes, and never attempt to drive through water that is covering the roadway. Through a habitat management agreement between the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (COE), the land surrounding the Bull Shoals Lake offers a vast opportunity for nature viewing, hiking, hunting, fishing, and recreational use. There are several access points along the lake and its tributaries, some are maintained by MDC, some by the COE , and some are not maintained but still provide public access to the managed lands around the lake. The lake provides hydroelectric power generation, and provides flood control for the White River below the dam, as well as for Taneycomo, Table Rock, and Beaver Lakes upstream. The lake is subject to fluctuating water levels and often times covers area roads and parking areas.

Truman Reservoir management lands consist of 58,133 acres distributed around the reservoir in parts of Henry, Benton, Hickory, and St. Clair counties in west central Missouri. The reservoir lies within the upper Osage River basin where the Ozarks meet the Plains. Historically, Native Americans occupying this area were principally Osage, Shawnee, and Kickapoo. Early explorers and pioneers making their way west traveled the basin, while the French trapped along the Osage River and traded with the Native Americans. Place names like Marais des Cygnes, Marmaton, Pomme de Terre, and Thibaut are vivid reminders of the early French influence in the Upper Osage Valley.

The reservoir lies within the upper Osage River basin where the Ozarks meet the Plains. Historically, Native Americans occupying this area were principally Osage, Shawnee, and Kickapoo. Early explorers and pioneers making their way west traveled the basin, while the French trapped along the Osage River and traded with the Native Americans. Place names like Marais des Cygnes, Marmaton, Pomme de Terre, and Thibaut are vivid reminders of the early French influence in the Upper Osage Valley.

67	knob-lick-towersite	Knob Lick Towersite	Missouri Conservation Areas	Towersites	Towersite	" Knob Lick Towersite Knob Lick Towersite Knob Lick Towersite is an 80-acre towersite purchased from the U.S. Forest Service for use as a fire detection tower to locate wildfires in southern St. Francois and northern Madison counties. Although used regularly in the past, the tower is only seldom used now because few wild areas exist within the tower's viewing range. However, the tower continues to provide a commanding view of the area. The view of the flatwoods valley from the tower is beautiful. A small granite glade provides a panoramic view of the same area for those who prefer to sightsee from the ground. This rocky, granite glade is the open area just south of the lookout tower. It is covered with little bluestem and Indian grass, as well as many wildflowers, such as tickseed, pine-weed, and sunflowers. Glades provide important habitat for turkey and quail and are homes for eastern collared lizards and flathead snakes. Many songbirds, such as red-eyed vireos and indigo buntings, live on or near glades.

80	maintz-wildlife-preserve	Maintz Wildlife Preserve	Missouri Conservation Areas	Wildlife	Preserve	" Maintz Wildlife Preserve Maintz Wildlife Preserve The Maintz Wildlife Preserve is an 804-acre area of rolling hills located in northwestern Cape Girardeau County. The area is named after Ty Maintz, an Oak Ridge bird hunter and nature lover who in the mid 1970s donated 250 acres and funds to buy more land. Before acquisition by the Conservation Department, the Maintz area was comprised of small, intensively used farms. On the area, the Department emphasizes upland game management especially for bobwhite quail by managing for early successional habitat. Prescribed burning, disking, timber stand improvement, edge feathering, and farming are used to create and maintain early successional habitat. Warm-season grass and prairie wildflowers have been planted in some of the area's fields to provide nesting cover and brood rearing habitat for wildlife. Area crop fields are planted by local farmers and a portion of the crop is left standing in the fields over winter for wildlife food. There are several small ponds stocked with largemouth bass, bluegill, and channel catfish. Some small fishless ponds, and one larger seasonal wetland have been created for amphibians, shorebirds, and waterfowl.

82	caldwell-memorial-wildlife-area	Caldwell Memorial Wildlife Area	Missouri Conservation Areas	Wildlife	Wildlife Area	" Caldwell Memorial Wildlife Area Caldwell Memorial Wildlife Area Sam Caldwell donated his farm to the Missouri Department of Conservation in 1975. Mr. Caldwell was a direct descendant of Kinkaid Caldwell, the first American settler in Franklin County. The 125-acre Wildlife Area was originally part of a 172-acre Spanish land grant owned by James Cowan. Cowan conveyed the land to John Sullins. Sullins conveyed the land to Kinkaid Caldwell on December 22, 1817. Ownership of the farm passed from Kinkaid to his son, John; from John to his son, Sam; from Sam to his son, the late Samuel Caldwell.The Caldwell Area will serve to provide educational opportunities for students, young adults, suburban landowners, sportspersons, and conservation public interest groups. Use of the area will assist Missourians' understanding of and personal connections with our fish, forest, and wildlife resources. The desired result is to increase participation and interest in nature-based activities. Birding, fishing, native landscaping, nature-viewing, nature photography, and other outdoor skills will be available at the Caldwell Memorial Wildlife Area.

Paris Wildlife Area Carrick W. Davidson - Robert G. Paris Wildlife Area Carrick W. Davidson/Robert G. Paris Wildlife Area is located in east-central Howell County. It is about seven miles northeast of West Plains, off of Route EE. Of the 270 acres that comprise the Carrick W. Davidson/Robert G. Paris Wildlife Area, 200 acres are mixed warm-season grasses, old fields and crop land. The remainder of the land is wooded. There is a two-acre pond and three smaller ponds on the property. Middle Fork Creek meanders through the area. The area was donated to the Missouri Department of Conservation by Mr. and Mrs. Carrick W. Davidson and the family of the late Robert Paris. They started purchasing the property in 1955. Their primary purpose for the property was recreation. The property was managed for wildlife, primarily quail. They ran cattle on the property, but never at the expense of quail. Present management techniques include converting cool-season grasses to warm-season species, prescribed burning and cropping to maintain early successional habitat. Area facilities include two parking lots.

O. and Leda J. Sears Memorial Wildlife Area Notice Hunting is not allowed on Sears Conservation Area due to deed restriction. F.O. and Leda J. Sears Memorial Wildlife Area (Sears WA) is 3.5 miles north of Rush Hill on Route B. The property was purchased to provide habitat for greater prairie chickens in Audrain County. Unfortunately, prairie chickens have since disappeared from the Audrain County landscape with the most recent known occurrence of nearby prairie chickens is 1995. All of the open acres were planted with a mix of native grasses and forbs.The area is poorly drained with little topographic relief and with a hard clay-pan soil layer. The planted prairie vegetation is managed with prescribed fire and wet prairie plants are common across the area. The grassland and surrounding hedgerows provide an oasis of wildlife habitat in a landscape dominated by intensive agriculture. Six circular fishless ponds were constructed to provide reptile and amphibian habitat.Hunting is not allowed on this area.

90	henry-jackson-waters-c-b-moss-memorial-wildlife-area	Henry Jackson Waters and C. B. Moss Memorial Wildlife Area	Missouri Conservation Areas	Wildlife	Wildlife Area	" Henry Jackson Waters and C. B. Moss Memorial Wildlife Area Henry Jackson Waters and C. B. Moss Memorial Wildlife Area Daniel Doresy Moss acquired this property sometime after 1875, and it became known as ""Hill Crest Farm"". Mr. Moss was an associate professor of chemistry at the Unversity of Missouri and he began the business of producing smallpox vaccine at this location. This business continued for several years until competition in the vaccine business made it more profitable to raise cows on the farm. Dairying became the chief income operation of Hill Crest Farm, and this business, under several ownerships but using the same name, ""Hillcrest Dairy"", was the primary use of the property. The Moss home, a stately, two-story, frame structure was the site of much social life for Columbians during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After the Moss Family ceased living in the home, it was converted to small apartments and during the 1950's and 60's, University of Missouri students frequently rented rooms in the home. At the time of its donation to the Department of Conservation, the Moss home, the ""Grade A"" dairy barn and foreman's house had been converted to small, rental apartments. Students who rented these rooms enjoyed the best of the country living while still being less than one mile from the campus of the university. Both Mr. C.B. Moss and Mr. H.J. Waters donated their respective parts of the Hillcrest farm to the Department in 1972. Each retained life estate for himself, and in the case of Mr. Waters, for his wife also. Both gentlemen preceded Mrs. Waters in death, and in 1975 the Department took possession of the Moss twenty acre tract which contained the house and converted apartments. The house was remodeled to serve as office space for department personnel based in Columbia, and it served in this capacity until January, 1983. Department personnel moved from the Moss house at that time and it was to be sold for material salvage in preparation for the construction of the Columbia District Headquarters. Shortly after it was empty, an arsonist set the structure afire in the early morning hours and it was completely incinerated. The Department took possession of the entire area after Mrs. Waters' death in 1985. In 2009 the Department entered into an agreement with the City of Columbia to manage part of this area as a city park. The MDC offices and shop were remodeled to accomodate park activities and other park developments are ongoing.The area has been in the City of Columbia's archery program the past severalyears. Archers that wish to hunt the area must attend the City of Columbia's August presentation, be on their approve hunters list, and get a car hang tag.

Reed Memorial Wildlife Area The James A. Reed Memorial Wildlife Area is located in Jackson County, south of Highway 50 near Lee's Summit. This wildlife area was established in 1952 after Mrs. Nell Reed donated 731 acres of land to the Missouri Department of Conservation in memory of her husband, Senator James A. Reed. Additional tracts were purchased using federal monies and department funds to bring the area to its present 3,084 acres. Development of the area and construction of lakes began in 1957. Since then, over 252 acres of water have been impounded to form 12 lakes, ranging in size from one to 42 acres. Most lakes contain largemouth bass, channel catfish, crappie, bluegill, and redear sunfish. In addition, hybrid striped bass have been stocked in most of the lakes, and rainbow trout are stocked for the winter fishing season (Nov-Mar) in Coot and Plover lakes and in Honker Pond (kids only). The area also has numerous small ponds. Woodlands, native grass plantings, shrub plantings, and crop fields are managed to provide year-round food for wildlife. Giant Canada geese nest and winter at the Reed Area. The area also supports good numbers of white-tailed deer. This wildlife area was acquired, developed, and is managed in part through the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act and the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Murphy Memorial State Forest and Wildlife Area John F. Murphy Memorial State Forest and Wildlife Area John Fisher Murphy had been a friend, student and protector of the land and conservation movement most of his life. Prior to retirement, he was actively involved as office manager of the Hickory County ASCS Office. This job, his love for the land that had been in his family since the turn of the century, and his close association with several farm foresters and conservation agents, resulted in the bequeath of this land to the Missouri State Conservation Commission in 1981. An additional 110 acres were purchased in 1990.Mr. Murphy, also known as Mike, was a small built Irish man. He was educated (a former teacher), well read and could converse on most any topic. He asked many questions and some of them were loaded questions. He had a sly sense of humor, but never used it to intentionally embarrass you. Historical records show that the Cross Timbers (to Quincy) Spur Road of the Old Butterfield State Coach Line curved up the southwest of the tract. According to local stories, passengers took refuge on the area during bad storms. Another legend tells that during the Civil War, an underground railroad to help slaves escape to freedom passed through this area. The Mansion, a two-story house used as a refuge for the slaves on their journey, stood on a farmstead about a mile west of the forest boundary.John Fisher Murphy Memorial Forest and Wildlife Area is managed primarily for forest upland wildlife habitat. Small open areas are managed to provide forest edge habitat with early successional habitat mixtures maintained on some parts of the area. Hunting is allowed and there are opportunities for wildlife viewing.

97	wayne-helton-memorial-wildlife-area	The Wayne Helton Memorial Wildlife Area	Missouri Conservation Areas	Wildlife	Wildlife Area	" The Wayne Helton Memorial Wildlife Area The Wayne Helton Memorial Wildlife Area The Conservation Department established this wildlife area in 1969 with the purchase of 440 acres from Nina Pauline Helton, widow of the late J. Wayne Helton, who served as the conservation agent for Caldwell and Daviess counties from 1941 until 1965. The purchase of several additional tracts since 1969 has increased the area to its current size. The northwest corner of the area includes the Helton Prairie Natural Area, one of the best examples of native prairie in north Missouri. Nearly 200 native prairie plants have been identified on the 30-acre natural area. Because of its size and diversity, Wayne Helton Memorial Wildlife Area is managed for a wide range of game and non-game wildlife species. Management activities on the area include farming, prescribed burning, native vegetation establishment, discing, and food plots. Very few unplowed prairies exist in northern Missouri. Wildflower displays are especially notable from mid-May until early July.
