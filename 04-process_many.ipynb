      "Round 2: The Henry Jackson Waters and C. B. Moss Memorial Wildlife Area is a remarkable natural sanctuary spanning 113.2 acres near Columbia, Missouri. This area boasts a captivating history, starting with its acquisition by C. B. Moss in the late 19th century. Initially named Hill Crest Farm, the property played a significant role in the production of smallpox vaccine, a venture that lasted for several years until competition in the industry led to a shift in focus. Moss then transitioned the farm into a dairy operation, known as Hillcrest Dairy, which became the primary income source for the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of the farm was the Moss home, a grand two-story structure that served as a social hub for Columbians during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After the Moss family moved out, the home was converted into small apartments, providing housing for University of Missouri students in the 1950s and 1960s. This period of student occupancy added a unique chapter to the area's history. In a remarkable act of conservation, both Mr. C. B. Moss and Mr. H. J. Waters donated their respective portions of the farm to the Department of Conservation in 1972, retaining life estates. This donation ensured the preservation of the land for future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the deaths of Mr. Moss and Mr. Waters, the Department of Conservation gained full possession of the entire area in 1985. Since then, the wildlife area has undergone significant changes and developments. In 2009, a collaborative agreement was reached with the City of Columbia, resulting in the management of a portion of the land as a city park. This partnership has led to various improvements, including the remodeling of MDC offices and shops to accommodate park activities. The area now offers a range of recreational opportunities, including hiking, sightseeing, and nature observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wildlife area is particularly renowned for its archery program, which is part of the City of Columbia's archery initiative. Archers interested in hunting within the area must attend an August presentation and be on the approved hunters list, with a car hang tag required. The area provides an ideal habitat for deer and wild turkeys, making it a popular destination for hunters and nature enthusiasts alike. Visitors can also enjoy the diverse flora, featuring sycamore, black walnut, and white-tailed deer, adding to the natural beauty of the landscape.\n",
